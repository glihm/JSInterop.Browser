JSInterop.Browser
=================

A library to work with Blazor and web browsers web APIs easily.

The motivation for this library is that there are few projects with the overall browser's web apis in a single place.
The idea of this project is to create a very .NET friendly way to interact with the browsers from C# code in Blazor.

Work **actively** in progress... Only on branch `main` for now. :)
